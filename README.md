# FORK INFO

This is a fork of Robert David Graham's [MASSCAN](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan), with added support for pinging Minecraft servers and saving the response as a banner.

All usage remains exactly the same. Please visit the original project's info page for more info. I might submit a PR if I can manage to clean up the code.
